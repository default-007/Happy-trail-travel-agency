    <p>Kenya is the heart of East Africa, a vast country that possesses golden beaches, massive wilderness areas and a wealth of fascinating tribal rituals. It is often seen as the first port of call for any African safari or a stepping-stone to
      subsequent safaris in Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Southern Africa. Because of Kenya’s historic tourism development, the country’s infrastructure is sophisticated and its national parks well-maintained with a vast array of accommodation
      available, to suit every style, taste and budget.</p>
